#### PROJECT TITLE ####
2D Turn-based Strategy Game



#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION ####
Our project will be a turn-based strategy game in which the player navigates a procedurally-generated "overworld" map and engages enemy NPCs (Non-Player Characters).

The objective of the player is to complete as many levels as possible and see how long they can survive in the game. To complete a level, the player must reach the
door/stairs present on that level. However, enemy NPCs will attempt to stop the player and slow their progress. 

When an engagement begins, the screen will shift from map-mode to combat-mode, in which the player will take turns against the computer selecting moves for their 
character to perform. During this time, the player can take damage from the NPC, depleting the player's health. When the player runs out of health completely, their 
character dies and the player must restart the game, and since lost health will not regenerate outside of combat, the player must be wary of what encounters they
engage in and plan ahead in order to successfully progress in the game.

(DEPENDING ON TIME)
Depending on the level of the map, the npc will be more tough and therefore the player has to gain plenty of equipment and skills on the way.
There will be shops every x map levels where the player can buy health potions or possible equipment.

If opponents become too strong the player has the option to return to the (previous-1) shop map, at the cost of all items being lost with exception for "special" items, money and stats.

Additionally, during the game, the player will encounter certain riddles in order to maintain a story.
The goal is for the player to reach the highest level map (an exact number will be given from start) and the player will be rewarded with the solution to the riddles.
