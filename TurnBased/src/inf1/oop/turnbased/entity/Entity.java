/* =========================
 * CLASS DETAILS
 * ---------------
 * 
 * CONSTRUCTOR: 
 * Entity object_name = new Entity(int x, int y, String name, int damage, int movespeed, int totalhealth)
 * 
 * creates the entity object_name with given x-y positions, name, damage, movespeed and totalhealth.
 * eg. for a wall we could have: Entity(10,5,"wall",0,0,999);
 * 
 *  
 * METHODS:
 * getObject() returns the object in order to access an object from separate methods and classes.
 * getX() returns x
 * setX(x) sets x
 * getY() returns y
 * setY(y) sets y
 * getName() returns name
 * setName(name) sets name
 * getDamage() returns damage
 * attack() get attack, returns damage with a randomised equation and depending on weapon held.
 * setDamage(dmg) returns damage
 * getHealth() returns health
 * setHealth(health) sets health to new health, limits health to max-health if it exceeds the total.
 * addTotalHealth(health) adds health to totalhealth. use negative number to subtract
 * heal(heal) increases current health by heal amount. Automagically limits heal to the total if required.
 * hit(hit) decreases current health by hit amount. Death script when health equals or falls below 0.
 * died() automatically triggered when ownhealth <= 0. What to do in this method? see suggestions in method.
