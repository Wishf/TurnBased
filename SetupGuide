NOTE FOR NEW PROGRAMMERS:
I can guarantee that it is boring when you're not into it, similarly for when reading books and such.
Setting up and getting everyone at the same level right from start is therefore very important.
Once everything is set-up and working properly, we can start assigning tasks and get started.
This is where things will get interesting..! :)

First task for all of us: get this installation/setup list filled in so that we can start.

---------------------------------------------------------
SETUP REQUIRED IN ORDER TO START PROGRAMMING:
---------------------------------------------------------

- Install the JAVA JDK -> http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  note: general requirement to work with java at all 

- Install Eclipse -> http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

- ?possibly add a step here related to android/html5 setup (not sure if it libgdx works without?
  note: we will be creating the game to run on a regular desktop, so don't let this confuse you

- Install and Implement libgdx in Eclipse -> http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/
  note: this will help in setting up the game basics, i.e. setting up an interactive game window instead of working in terminal commands

- ?any way to directly connect eclipse to github?
  One way to do this is using the EGit plugin. A nifty guide on it is here: http://www.vogella.com/articles/EGit/article.html
  I will try to do an adapted example once we get started on Friday if you want, it has worked quite well with Bitbucket(git) for me.

- Anything more?

---------------------------------------------------------

LIST COMPLETE: NO
